-------

To compile, first run

 $ tools/build_ffmpeg.sh
 $ tools/copy_ffmpeg.sh

The first command is a custom build script to build ffmpeg with only the
necessary features, and the second command moves the shared object files to the
place where CMake is configured to find them. Then, to build Semitone, run
either of the following commands:

 $ gradle buildDebug
 $ gradle buildRelease
